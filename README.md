## NPNT Compliance for Drones with Arduino

This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive solution for achieving NPNT (No Permission, No Takeoff) compliance for drones using Arduino hardware. NPNT is a regulatory framework implemented by the Government of India that mandates certain requirements for operating drones in the country.

# Overview
The NPNT Compliance for Drones with Arduino Hardware project aims to simplify the process of ensuring compliance with the NPNT regulations. It includes Arduino code and associated libraries that enable drone operators to integrate NPNT functionality into their drone hardware.

# Features
- NPNT Compliance: The code in this repository helps drone operators implement the NPNT compliance requirements, including registration, obtaining permissions, and adhering to airspace restrictions.
- Arduino Compatibility: The code is designed to work seamlessly with Arduino-based drone hardware, providing an easy integration process.
- Permission Check: The system verifies if the necessary permissions have been obtained for a particular flight by communicating with the NPNT server.
- GPS Integration: The project incorporates GPS functionality to ensure accurate positioning and adherence to restricted areas.
